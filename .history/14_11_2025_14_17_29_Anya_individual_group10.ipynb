    "### Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed method: K Nearest Neighbours Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this method is appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict whether a player will subscribe to a game related newsletter, which is a binary classification problem with two outcomes, true or false. KNN classification works based on the majority class of the chosen number of nearest datapoints (K). It can adapt well to new data and can work with multiple predictor variables without assuming connections between the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions if there are any:\n",
    "- The data once scaled should stop bias in the classifications. \n",
    "- There is no missing data. \n",
    "- Players with closely related data(experience, play time, etc.) are similar and will follow similar subscription patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of this model:\n",
    "- KNN classification model can be sensitive to noise, imbalanced data (must scale data) and outliers.\n",
    "- Can overfit or underfit data depending on value of k. \n",
    "- Can be slow for large datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Comparing and Selecting Model:\n",
    "- Cross validation (10 folds) and analysis of accuracy will be used on the training data to choose the best value for k.\n",
    "- The final model will be run on the testing data and will be analyzed using accuracy, precision, recall and a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing Data to apply to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split data into a training(70%) and testing(30%) set using intitial_split function.\n",
    "2. Preprocess data:\n",
    "   - Standardize the numeric data to ensure unbiased predictions.\n",
    "   - Change all categorical variables to factors using as_factor.\n",
    "   - Set the seed.\n",
    "3. Use cross validation with 10 folds as this is a smaller dataset(less bias) on the training data to tune the model. This will prevent overfitting and ensure the model will work well with the unseen data later.\n",
    "  - Train the classifier using workflow and tune_grid() using values of k from 1 to 20 by 1. \n",
    "  - Predict the labels within each fold and calculate accuracy for each K value. Use this to choose best value of K. \n",
    "4. Assess the model on the unseen testing dataset using accuracy, precision, recall and a confusion matrix. "
